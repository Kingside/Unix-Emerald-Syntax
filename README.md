# Unix-Emerald-Syntax
A classic Unix like syntax highlighting theme that borrows heavily from the now deprecated emerald-syntax. For anyone that likes green, this is for you.

As stated in the main description this syntax theme borrows heavily from the existing and now deprecated Emerald-Syntax with the sole author jasperandrew. This release of this syntax theme has four main purposes:
1) Fix issue with cursor being incorrectly offset.
2) Change name so that those interested in such a color scheme can find it more easily. It is jpjones6's belief that it is rather difficult to find a classic green Unix like syntax theme at present with Emerald-Syntax being about as close as it gets, however, it is broken.
3) Fix highlighting such that highlighted text can still be seen.
4) Update to take into account lack of shadow DOM boundary (Get rid of deprection) which will allow for the continued use of this theme in future Atom releases.
